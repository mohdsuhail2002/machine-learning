# Machine Learning Essentials by Mohd Suhail

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Starter Pack** — a one-stop repo for anyone who wants to understand the core concepts of ML, from the *math behind the magic* to *real implementation in Python*!

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This repo contains multiple Jupyter notebooks, neatly organized into key ML topics:

### 🔹 **1. Regression Models**
Understand how machines predict continuous values.
- Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)  
- Model Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)

### 🔹 **2. Classification Models**
Teach your model to make decisions — binary or multi-class.
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest & XGBoost  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### 🔹 **3. Math for Machine Learning**
No ML without math! Dive into the foundations:
- Linear Algebra Basics  
- Probability & Statistics  
- Gradient Descent Intuition  
- Activation Functions and Derivatives

### 🔹 **4. Outlier Detection**
Because not every data point plays nice 😅  
- Z-Score Method  
- IQR (Interquartile Range)  
- Isolation Forest (Advanced technique)
